A branch in Git is like a separate line of development.
You can think of it like creating a copy of your code where you can:
work on new features
fix bugs
experiment
make changes safely
All without affecting your main working project.
1.Create a new branch: git branch feature-login
2.Switch to a branch: git checkout feature-login 
new command: git switch feature-login
3.Create + switch in one step:git checkout -b feature-login
4.See all branches: git branchgit 
5.Delete a branch: git branch -d feature-login
6.Merge a branch into the current branch: git merge feature-login
